Challenge 1: Agriculture Commodities, Prices & Seasons

Aim: Your team is working on building a variety of insight packs to measure key trends in the Agriculture sector in India. You are presented with a data set around Agriculture and your aim is to understand trends in APMC (Agricultural produce market committee)/mandi price & quantity arrival data for different commodities in Maharashtra.

# Objective:

#### 1.Test and filter outliers.

#### 2.Understand price fluctuations accounting the seasonal effect

#### Detect seasonality type (multiplicative or additive) for each cluster of APMC and commodities

#### De-seasonalise prices for each commodity and APMC according to the detected seasonality type

#### 3.Compare prices in APMC/Mandi with MSP(Minimum Support Price)- raw and deseasonalised

#### 4.Flag set of APMC/mandis and commodities with highest price fluctuation across different commodities in each relevant season, and year.

Data:

Variable description:

msprice- Minimum Support Price

arrivals_in_qtl- Quantity arrival in market (in quintal)

min_price- Minimum price charged per quintal

max_price- Maximum price charged per quintal

modal_price- Mode (Average) price charged per quintal


Submissions:

Final cleaned file(s). (Bonus: if the files are shared using GitHub with well-versioned log)

Documentation around the methodology, analysis, and final results that you want to share with the Government of Maharashtra. Do use graphs and charts to substantiate your analysis. (Bonus- if you use GitHub pages / RPubs / etc. to share your documentation)

Script(s) and their documentation. (Bonus - using Jupyter Notebook or GitHub ReadMe.)

Visualisations, if any. (Bonus - if you use interactive dashboards)


Tip: The objective is to understand trends in each APMC and commodity separately so doing the analysis for just 1 commodity or APMC wonâ€™t help.
